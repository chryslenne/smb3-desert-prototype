# Super Mario Brothers 3 - Desert Prototype

The objective of this project is to showcase the capabilities of the Godot Engine by creating a prototype of the Desert Level from Super Mario Brothers 3. The prototype will include basic gameplay mechanics, level design, and visual assets resembling the iconic desert-themed level.

## Character and Controls:

Implementing the player character (Mario) with basic movement mechanics (e.g., walking, jumping, running).
Defining controls for player interaction (e.g., keyboard, gamepad).

## Level Design:

Creating a desert-themed world similar to the Desert Level in Super Mario Brothers 3.
Designing the layout of the level, including platforms, obstacles, and enemies.
Placing collectibles (e.g., coins, power-ups) throughout the level.

## Visual Assets:

Designing or sourcing graphical assets (sprites, backgrounds, tiles) for the desert theme.
Incorporating animations and effects (e.g., sandstorms) to enhance the visual experience.

## Gameplay Mechanics:

Implementing gameplay elements such as enemies (e.g., Goombas, Koopa Troopas), item blocks, and hazards (e.g., quicksand).
Introducing power-ups and their associated abilities (e.g., Super Mushroom, Fire Flower).
Implementing scoring and coin collection mechanics.

## User Interface:

Designing a simple user interface for displaying game information (e.g., score, lives).
Incorporating menus for starting, pausing, and restarting the game.

## Deliverables:
Upon completion, the project will deliver the following:

* A playable prototype of the Super Mario Brothers 3 Desert Level, showcasing basic gameplay mechanics elements.
* Source code and project files for the prototype, compatible with Godot Engine.
* Documentation or a guide explaining the key features and code structure of the prototype.
